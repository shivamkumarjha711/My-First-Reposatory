// Static Position: //

The default position value for elements.
Elements with position: static are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
The top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect on static positioned elements.
Example:

** Code **

<style>
  .box {
    position: static;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: red;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Static Box</div>

In this example, the .box element is positioned statically. It will be displayed in its normal position in the document flow.

************************************************************************

// Fixed Position: //

The element is positioned relative to the browser window.
It does not scroll with the rest of the page.
The top, right, bottom, and left properties can be used to specify its position.
Example:

** Code **
<style>
  .box {
    position: fixed;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Fixed Box</div>
In this example, the .box element is positioned fixedly with a top value of 50px and a left value of 50px. It will remain in the same position even if the page is scrolled.

************************************************************************

// Sticky Position: //

The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
It behaves like position: relative until the user scrolls to a specified threshold, then becomes position: fixed.
The top, right, bottom, and left properties can be used to specify its position.
Example:

** Code **
<style>
  .box {
    position: sticky;
    top: 20px;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: green;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Sticky Box</div>
In this example, the .box element is positioned as sticky with a top value of 20px. It will behave like a relative positioned element until the user scrolls to a specific point, at which it will stick to that position.

************************************************************************

// Relative Position: //

The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
It still takes up space in the normal flow of the document.
The top, right, bottom, and left properties can be used to adjust its position.
Example:

** Code **
<style>
  .box {
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: yellow;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Relative Box</div>
In this example, the .box element is positioned relatively with a top value of 20px and a left value of 20px. It will be shifted 20 pixels down and 20 pixels to the right from its normal position.

************************************************************************

// Absolute Position://

The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
If no positioned ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the browser window).
The top, right, `bottom
